# AConversationAboutAI.com — Full Local Site Structure

This is a Next.js 14 + TailwindCSS project with working pages for:

- Home
- /news and /news/[slug]
- /tools and /tools/[slug]
- /blog and /blog/[slug]

All content is mock data in TypeScript files so you can run everything locally
without any external services yet.

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.js (v18+).

2. In this folder, install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

From here we can later plug in Sanity CMS, newsletter, automation, and monetization.
