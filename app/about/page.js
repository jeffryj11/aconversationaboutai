      <p className="text-gray-200">
        AConversationAboutAI.com is a long-running exploration of how artificial intelligence intersects with
        policy, ethics, economics, and day-to-day life. It&apos;s intentionally slow, reflective, and
        grounded in real-world tradeoffs instead of hype.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-200">
        The goal is simple: keep humans at the center of the story while we build, regulate, and live with
        increasingly capable AI systems.
